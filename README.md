AMS 553 - Final Project Code
Author: David Miloschewsky

This repository contains the file qmc.ipynb which contains the code that was used for the project. It contains the following sections:
-   Probability distributions
    -   A brute-force algorithm that loads a probability into the amplitudes
    -   Examples of calls for basic distributions
-   Expectation & Variance
    -   Class simAlg which simulates the Monte Carlo algorithm
    -   Testing the gate complexity of F
-   cGAN test
